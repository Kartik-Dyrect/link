# Security Policy

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- ✅ **Supabase Auth Integration**: Secure user authentication with JWTs
- ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- ✅ **API Route Protection**: All user actions require authentication
- ✅ **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and validation

### Data Protection

- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored securely
- ✅ **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries via Supabase client
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- ✅ **XSS Protection**: React's built-in escaping + input sanitization

### API Security

- ✅ **CORS Protection**: Proper CORS headers
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Built-in via Vercel/hosting platform
- ✅ **URL Validation**: Prevents SSRF attacks
- ✅ **Protocol Restrictions**: Only HTTP/HTTPS allowed
- ✅ **Local Network Blocking**: Prevents internal network access

### Infrastructure Security

- ✅ **HTTPS Only**: Enforced in production
- ✅ **Service Role Key**: Separated from client-side code
- ✅ **Database Encryption**: Supabase handles encryption at rest
- ✅ **Secure Headers**: Next.js security headers

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Deployment

- Never commit `.env.local` or `.env` files
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Configure proper CORS policies
- Set up monitoring and logging

### Database

- RLS policies are enforced on all tables
- Service role key used only for trusted server operations
- No direct database connections from client
- Regular security updates for dependencies

### User Input

- All URLs are validated and sanitized
- File uploads not allowed (reduces attack surface)
- SQL injection prevented by using Supabase client
- XSS prevented by React's escaping

## 📋 Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Going Live

- [ ] Environment variables configured in hosting platform
- [ ] `.env.local` added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Domain added to Supabase allowed origins
- [ ] RLS policies tested and working
- [ ] No debug logs in production build
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest secure versions

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Review and update RLS policies as needed
- [ ] Monitor unusual API usage patterns
- [ ] Regular backups of database
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys periodically

## 🔧 Environment Variables

### Required for Production

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Security Notes

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are exposed to the client
- Service role key should never be exposed to the client
- Use different environments for development/staging/production
